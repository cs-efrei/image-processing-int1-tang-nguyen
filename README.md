  o Installation :
                                                                ---If you didn't install PyCharm and Git yet---
          • Install PyCharm Community Edition (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=mac ).
          • Have Git installed on your machine (https://git-scm.com/downloads ).
          • Have an account on the GitHub or GitLab platform (https://github.com/ )
                                                                  ---If you didn't create your project yet---
          • Log into your GitHub account.
          • Create a new repository by clicking on the "New Repository" button.
          • Enter a name for the repository (we recommend that you create it privately) and, if necessary, configure the required options, such as adding a README, .gitignore or license file.
          • Click on Create repository to complete this step.
          • You can now copy the URL of the remote repository (for example, https://github.com/votre-utilisateur/nom-du-depot.git) to link your local repository or to clone the repository.
                                                                   ---If you did the two previous steps---
          • Open PyCharm.
          • Go to File > Project from Version Control.
          • Paste the repository URL then click 'Clone'.
                                                                      ---Synchronize the two accounts---
          • Each time we need to push and commit (select the file you want) after changing something.
After that, the other collaborator have to pull on his own account to update the project.

  o How to use :
          • Open PyCharm and load the project (pyfort-nguyen-tang-int1).
          • Locate the file 'main.py' or run the function 'game()' on a Python file.
          • Click the button 'Run' to start the game.

                           -Interim submissions + overall review of the progress : -> Sunday 27/04/2025
                                                                                   -> Sunday 25/05/2025 (final submission)
                           -All the functions are programmed : towards the end of March (beginning)
                           -Review of all the functions and of the game (if it runs correctly) : early ...
      • Decisions made : 
      • Problems encountered :
   
    § Tasks distribution :
      • Minh-Lâm : worked on ...
      • Stéphanie : worked on ...
    For the review of each function, we alternated. When one of us finished the tasks given, he/she could review all the files and modify/correct the possible errors.
